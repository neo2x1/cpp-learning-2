# cpp-learning-2
This is my WIP project I've been working on for a while that is a summary of my c++ OOP practice.
# What is it?
It's a rpg-like game battle simulator. I know it sound simple but form programming viewpoint its far more complex/ 
# New things that I've learned by it
Creating this game helped me learn more about c++ programming. Things like:
- OOP programming
  - multifile .h and .cpp code
  - basics of objects
  - abstraction in programming
- a bit of pointers & references
