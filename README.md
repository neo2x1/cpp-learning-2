# cpp-learning-2
This is my WIP project I've been working on for a while that is a summary of my c++ OOP practice.
# What is it?
It's a rpg-like game battle simulator. I know it sound simple but form programming viewpoint its far more complex
# Gameplay loop
Each turn you can either attack one of the monsters from 1 to 20 dmg at random, or heal yourself 30 hp.
Then monsters attack you, dealing you from 1 to 20 hp at random
# New things that I've learned by it
Creating this game helped me learn more about c++ programming. Things like:
- OOP programming
  - multifile .h and .cpp code
  - basics of objects
  - abstraction in programming
- a bit of pointers & references
